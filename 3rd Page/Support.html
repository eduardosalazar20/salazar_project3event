    <p>FosterFun is welcome to invite everyone in the support of foster cares. FosterFun has partnered up with major organization
        in order to bring awareness to issues that foster carers lack, which is the lack of fundraiser and resources.
        Our number one task is to raise fundraisers and resources for the children in the foster homes,
       granting them the opportunity for them to have a bright future and make a difference in our society today.
