# project overview:


In this project we are tasked to research a poem or song that represents what community means to us. The poem that I'll be doing is a Church Poem. The poem goes like this "Here, a community gathered on Sundays, and in between A place of certainty and comfort in a world not solid, A source of faith, often tested and affirmed. Here, children dangled their legs from wooden pews. Wondering when playtime would come again. Trading glances with other children dressed in Sunday best. Here, women grew friendships for a lifetime Over quilting bees, Bible studies and bake sales While men huddled in conversation on the lawn. Here, couples vowed to love one another til death, Promising to lean on one another in times of challenge. And celebrate together in times of joy. Here, parents brought their babies to be blessed. Pledging to return to this place of faith and community. Joining a family larger than their own." Choosing this text for project 2, is a representation of what community means to me in the church. For me the church was a community that I felt welcomed in. Growing up in the church made me realize a lot about life and what it is about being part of a religion. The church has guided me to become a better person and it was a supportive community, not only for me but for my family and others as well. Another key part of this is it helps me relieve from any problems, stress or time to think. Without this community I think I would be lost in life and maybe be lost on what I want to do with my life. Due to school and work I'm not able to attend the church as much as I used to but I hope sometime in the near future I can make up some time to get back into attending my community. The words that I will be choosing to animate will be important words that speak to me when reading this poem. These are words that give me a sense of what the poem is trying to convey and how I think those words should act if they were to have a sense of life. The poem was shortened in order to focus on the important aspect of what community means to me.



# technical overview:

25 % of this project is completed. A logo exploration, moodboard, color, pattern and typography were done as part of the process to explore ideas on the direction it was heading to.

A wireframe was created on in Adobe XD. The wiframe created a potential design in order to refrenece and implament in our coding. The wireframe was revised from feedback and a new wirframe was set to go further in the next step. The software that will be used to create project 3 is visual studio code. 3 htmls and 1 css were created each having their own designated folder as part of this organization. Github will be our code hosting platform, Github link is ready and set. The layout of this project is to have the user interact will have a nav bar that links to the 2 other html pages. No Coding has been done yet but as in the works on how im going to code my 3 websites pages. For font choice the
