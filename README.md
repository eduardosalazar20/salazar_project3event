# project review:


In this project we are tasked to research a poem or song that represents what community means to us. The poem that I'll be doing is a Church Poem. The poem goes like this "Here, a community gathered on Sundays, and in between A place of certainty and comfort in a world not solid, A source of faith, often tested and affirmed. Here, children dangled their legs from wooden pews. Wondering when playtime would come again. Trading glances with other children dressed in Sunday best. Here, women grew friendships for a lifetime Over quilting bees, Bible studies and bake sales While men huddled in conversation on the lawn. Here, couples vowed to love one another til death, Promising to lean on one another in times of challenge. And celebrate together in times of joy. Here, parents brought their babies to be blessed. Pledging to return to this place of faith and community. Joining a family larger than their own." Choosing this text for project 2, is a representation of what community means to me in the church. For me the church was a community that I felt welcomed in. Growing up in the church made me realize a lot about life and what it is about being part of a religion. The church has guided me to become a better person and it was a supportive community, not only for me but for my family and others as well. Another key part of this is it helps me relieve from any problems, stress or time to think. Without this community I think I would be lost in life and maybe be lost on what I want to do with my life. Due to school and work I'm not able to attend the church as much as I used to but I hope sometime in the near future I can make up some time to get back into attending my community. The words that I will be choosing to animate will be important words that speak to me when reading this poem. These are words that give me a sense of what the poem is trying to convey and how I think those words should act if they were to have a sense of life. The poem was shortened in order to focus on the important aspect of what community means to me.



# technical overview:

100% of this project is completed. The software that was used to create this project was visual studio code. 9 htmls and 1 css were created each having their own folder to be organized. The layout of this project is to have the user interact with the text and take you to another page. The text that is chosen is " Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif ". The font was chosen in order to have a correlation to font that is used in bibles and religion which is mainly serifs. An Id class was set to a group which is called "PoemIntro". Specifications were set "display: flex, flex-direction: row, align-items: center; width: 100%; height: 100vh; background-color: white, color: #36bbf9 ,font-size: 25px, font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif.


Each word had their own id or class. For the first page, the text that is set for animation were " community, gathered and solid". Community and gathered animations are set to go up and unite as part of what it represents. The keyframes were set to scale and translate for both using negative and positive numbers to set their position. Solid has a div id with a nav, a tag, in order to target the next html 2. The animation for this was it would change color as a way to indicate the user to click on this specifically making a different color than the other blue color text.


Index 2 text animations are "dangled their legs and pews". Dangled legs used a class in order to have a hover effect. It was set as legs1:hover with a rotation. The animation is supposed to signify how I interpret these texts. Pews has an animation of being set to another color as an indication to click on the link to the next hmtl 3.


Index 3 text animations are "playtime, trading, glances and best". Play has a hover effect using a class. Playtimes animation was spinning 9000deg in order to represent something moving as it connects to children. Its set was playTime1:hover transform: rotate(9000deg). Trading and glances have this up and down motion giving it a sense of glancing eachother. Both had the keyframes are 50% transform: scale(1) translate(0px,-120px)-100% transform: scale(1). With a small dely in the animation start. Best has an animation of being set to another color as in indication to click on the link to the next hmtl 4.


Index 4 text animations "grew friendships and sales". Grew friendships has an id of "womenFriendship" in order to have an animation set. This represents the growth of something making it go up. It has the setup of keyframes womenFriendship: transform: scale(1) to transform: scale(3) and translate(0px,-50px). sales is not yet animated but it is still in the process. The nav and a tag was applied to the word connecting to html 5.


Index 5 text animations are "men, huddled and till death". Men and huddle had an id of the same name. Keyframes for men were set to menMove from transform:200px,10px to transform: rotate(-30deg) translate(20px, 0px), in order to have the text move into the other text huddled. For huddled the keyframe was set huddledMove from transform:200px,10px, to transform: rotate(30deg)translate(-20px, 0px). This has the same animation as men but going towards men text. This animation gives life to both words showing a representation of what two words mean how I interpret it. The till death animation has an id set in order to get the animation to go down representing death as death usually means something going towards the ground. It's set to @keyframes death2 from transform:scale(1) to color:black; transform: scale(3) translate(0px,50px).


Index 6 text animations are " challenge, celebrate and in times of joy". Challenge has a hover effect. The animation is unstable as the challenge isn't alway straight. Celebrate has animation of a spinning effect showing a form of celebration. It is set to celebrate2:hover transform:rotateY(1000deg) to skew(17deg). Lastly the times of joy has an animation of a color change to its standard color to a gold color. This hints as an indication of clicking the link to go to the next html 7 page.


Index 7 text animations are "babies and blessed". The baby's text has an id tag as the animation is set to go up and head right into the blessed text. This animation was done by using a keyframe. It was using a 50% of transform: scale(1) translate(0px,-80px) to 100% transform: translate(227px, 0px). The purpose of this animation was set to represent babies being brought over, which has a rising start and heading over. Blessed has a color change to its standard color and to its gold color linking to html 8.


Index 8 text animations are "faith and community". Faith and community have animation of changing to a gold color, a glowing effect. This animation was set to signify a light source of god signifying his presence in faith and community. An id was set to get this effect using a keyframe. A keyframe of 50% of transform: scale(1) translate(0px,-80px) to 100% to transform: translate(227px, 0px). Community is set to have an a tag and nav to html 9.


Index 9 text animations are "joining a family larger than their own". For the final animation all of the texts gather together as a way to represent a 1 whole family joining together. The id class was set to get this animation using keyframes joinfam1 starting at 0%, 10%,100% to width: 0 to 70%, 90% to a width of 100%. The end includes a scrolling page that will lead you to the credit of the author and a view of the full poem.
