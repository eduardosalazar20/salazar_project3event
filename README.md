# project overview:


In this project we are tasked to research a poem or song that represents what community means to us. The poem that I'll be doing is a Church Poem. The poem goes like this "Here, a community gathered on Sundays, and in between A place of certainty and comfort in a world not solid, A source of faith, often tested and affirmed. Here, children dangled their legs from wooden pews. Wondering when playtime would come again. Trading glances with other children dressed in Sunday best. Here, women grew friendships for a lifetime Over quilting bees, Bible studies and bake sales While men huddled in conversation on the lawn. Here, couples vowed to love one another til death, Promising to lean on one another in times of challenge. And celebrate together in times of joy. Here, parents brought their babies to be blessed. Pledging to return to this place of faith and community. Joining a family larger than their own." Choosing this text for project 2, is a representation of what community means to me in the church. For me the church was a community that I felt welcomed in. Growing up in the church made me realize a lot about life and what it is about being part of a religion. The church has guided me to become a better person and it was a supportive community, not only for me but for my family and others as well. Another key part of this is it helps me relieve from any problems, stress or time to think. Without this community I think I would be lost in life and maybe be lost on what I want to do with my life. Due to school and work I'm not able to attend the church as much as I used to but I hope sometime in the near future I can make up some time to get back into attending my community. The words that I will be choosing to animate will be important words that speak to me when reading this poem. These are words that give me a sense of what the poem is trying to convey and how I think those words should act if they were to have a sense of life. The poem was shortened in order to focus on the important aspect of what community means to me.



# technical overview:

25 % of this project is completed. A logo exploration, moodboard, color, pattern and typography were done as part of the process to explore ideas on the direction it was heading to. All of the explorations were created in adobe illustrator. The research that was gathered gave information about the organization that I'm supporting. 3 sets of logos were created implementing a meaning and clear representation of a foster care. The colors are a blue and a yellow as a correlation to what the colors represent foster children. These colors were ultimately used in the wireframes. Typography implemented a number of fonts, for the logo adobe fonts "Chaloops" was used for the logo. As for the webpage Adobe fonts Alternate Gothic No3 D, Interstate and Marvin round where used for the info, titles and nav bars. Patterns were created using the gradient as potential use for the wirframes. The wireframes were created in Adobe XD, which gave a potential website design that will catch the viewer's eye giving a sense of what this website is about. The wireframe will be used as part of a reference and implemented in our coding.The wireframe was revised from feedback and a new wireframe was set to go further in the next step. The software that will be used to create project 3 is visual studio code. 3 htmls and 1 css were created each having their own designated folder as part of this organization. Github will be our code hosting platform, Github link is ready and set. The layout of this project is to have the user interact will have a nav bar that links to the 2 other html pages. No Coding has been done yet but as in the works on how i'm going to code my 3 websites pages. The Code that will be used to create all the selections, will be h1-h6 tags, p , ul, nav and li tags. These selections will contribute in the aspects of the website. Such as color, fonts, navigations, spacing, adjusting images. To create the navigation bar the use of the navigation tag will construct the navigation bar, which consisted of a white background with an inline format to ensure that the navigationbars were aligned on a single line. Img will be used to set my images in my home page, event page and support page.
